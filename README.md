# Individual-Research-Profile-Generation

### About the Project:

The goal of this project is to provide students and researchers with powerful tools to streamline the management and analysis of scholarly literature. These Python scripts offer efficient methods for generating Excel sheets containing organized literature data and automating the extraction of valuable information from Google Scholar.

### This project forms part of a college-oriented initiative focusing on Innovative Product Development (IPD), a two-year endeavor aimed at nurturing innovation and fostering creative thinking among students.

### Excel Sheet Generation:

The `Excel Sheet Generation.py` script enables users to:

- **Filter Papers by Keyword:** Users can enter a keyword to filter papers based on titles and authors, facilitating targeted searches for specific topics or authors.
  
- **Generate Word Clouds:** The script generates word clouds based on the titles and authors of the retrieved literature, offering visual representations of the most frequent terms and names.

- **Retrieve All Papers:** Users can retrieve all papers associated with a particular professor, providing a comprehensive overview of their scholarly contributions.

### Google Scholar Data Extraction:

The `Extraction Final.py` script automates the extraction of literature data from Google Scholar. It retrieves essential information such as:

- **Titles**
- **Authors**
- **Publication Dates**
- **Journal Details**
- **Volume, Issue, and Pages**
- **Publisher Information**
- **Total Citations**
- **Document Types**
- **Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)**
- **Links to Publications**

The extracted data is then organized and saved into an Excel file for further analysis and reference.

### How to Use:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the desired script (`Excel Sheet Generation.py` or `Extraction Final.py`) and follow the on-screen prompts to input the necessary information.
